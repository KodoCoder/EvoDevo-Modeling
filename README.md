# EvoDevo-Modeling

Working, but still in development for additional features and easier usage/maintainability.
Has been used in the following published experiments:

The two bullet folders contain zlib licenses, and the "multi_evodevo" and "c++" folders contain the Modified BSD License.  You should read those to know your rights to these works.
To be clear, I did not have anything to do with the creation of Bullet Physics. I am just using it and providing it in this package so you don't have to do that leg-work.

If you want to use graphics on top of Bullet Physics, you'll also need to get some version of OpenGL and GLUT.  
Here's a resource that'll help you figure out how to get them on your machine: http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~sugih/courses/eecs487/glut-howto/#linux
