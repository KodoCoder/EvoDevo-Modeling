* Generate Population
** Purpose
+ This code creates *n* genomes.  A genome has *c* characters, 18000
  for the current project.  Each character is a digit from 0 to 3.
** Use
+ This code will be used to create a list of genomes that define a
  population of agents.  This code will only be used once per
  population per experiment, because the following populations are
  created via the selection and reproduction functions.
+ The genomes, one at a time, will be parsed into sequences, the
  sequences will be developed into parts, the parts will be combined
  into an agent, and then the blueprint for the agent will be piped to
  the C++ Bullet Physics code to be created and "live" its life.
